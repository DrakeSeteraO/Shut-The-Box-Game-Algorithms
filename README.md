# Shut-The-Box-Game-Algorithms
A simple program where you can test the affectiveness of different algorithms by simulating shut the box game.

I build it on my phone so it is not the neatess code. There is no UI, but at the top in the code you will see variables you can change and mess around with before you run the simulation. Let me know if you are having any problems.
